Problem Statement
The Continuous Galvanizing Line (CGL) plays a critical role in steel manufacturing by applying a protective zinc coating to steel sheets. However, inconsistencies in coating weight, material hardness, and process parameters can lead to:
‚ö†Ô∏è Defects in steel sheets, affecting product quality.
‚ö†Ô∏è Inefficient use of raw materials, increasing production costs.
‚ö†Ô∏è Unexpected equipment failures, leading to downtime.

This ML model aims to provide data-driven insights to optimize the CGL process, reducing errors and improving efficiency.
